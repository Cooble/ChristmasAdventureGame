entity.joe.blueprint=I can see how to make quadracopter. I found it in Guidebook where are listed materials for crafting.
entity.joe.ingredients=Well, let's see. For Quadracopter I will need Battery, probably really big, next I will need some Electronics, also an engine, surely electric, and 4 Airscrews. I wonder whether I can get all those materials and where I could craft such a thing?
entity.joe.idea=Let me think. We have to save Santa and Santa was kidnapped in his sledge. I need similar vehicle to be able to get to him, but there is no such machine or is it?
entity.joe.quadraidea=Oh... that's it! That's the solution of the cannot-get-to-Santa-problem! With that I can save him, but I'm afraid I won't find it anywhere.
